### üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

Backend Software Engineer with strong experience in designing and evolving distributed systems using Java (Spring Boot, Jakarta EE) and Golang. At Ita√∫ Unibanco, I work on large-scale modernization, transforming legacy monoliths into scalable, maintainable microservices using DDD, Clean Architecture, and SOLID principles.

I combine hands-on development with architectural guidance ‚Äî covering API design, asynchronous messaging (Kafka, Camel), observability (Datadog), CI/CD pipelines, AWS infrastructure, and performance tuning.

As a committer to  [Apache TomEE](https://tomee.apache.org/) and contributor to Jakarta EE and MicroProfile, I help improve enterprise Java runtimes and developer experience through open source contributions and community engagement.

Passionate about clean code, simplicity, and building software that evolves with the business.
